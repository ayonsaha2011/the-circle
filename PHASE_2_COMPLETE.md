- **Message Expiration**: Configurable auto-deletion for enhanced security
- **Read Receipts**: Privacy-respecting message acknowledgments

### 2. Secure File Vault System
- **Client-Side Encryption**: Files encrypted before upload using AES-256
- **Granular Access Controls**: Private, conversation, and public access levels
- **Dramatic Vault Door UI**: Cinematic security entrance with animations
- **File Sharing**: Secure sharing with permission management
- **Auto-Expiration**: Configurable file expiration for security
- **Upload Progress**: Real-time upload status with encryption progress

### 3. Video Communication (WebRTC)
- **1-to-1 Video Calling**: Direct peer-to-peer video calls
- **1-to-Many Broadcasting**: Group video capabilities
- **Screen Sharing**: Secure screen share functionality
- **Audio/Video Controls**: Mute/unmute with real-time indicators
- **Connection Management**: Robust connection handling and recovery

### 4. Enhanced Member Dashboard
- **Vault Door Entry**: Dramatic security-themed access experience
- **Member Status Indicators**: Real-time online/offline/away/busy status
- **Activity Logs**: Comprehensive security event tracking
- **User Presence**: Advanced presence management with custom status
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time activity and security alerts
